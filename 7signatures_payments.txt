There are several steps needed to process policy signature and payment.

For signature types, there are several available options. At least one of them was agreed as a part of partner contract between partner and Defend.

Signature types:

- signed proposal

- authorized by SMS

- authorized by payment

- authorization not required

- authorized by external system


As a part of the partner contact, there has to be an agreement regarding payment methods. There are two options:

- payment before sign is required

- payment before sign is not required


The following steps depend on the combination of signature type and payment method, that was set during policy creation. The signature type can be obtained by calling `/api/policies/{id}` call with id = ID of created policy.

### [Direct link to heading](https://defend-insurance-holding.gitbook.io/api-documentation/steps-for-creating-policy/signatures-payments\#if-signature-type-authorized-by-external-system)    If signature type = authorized by external system

For partners, the usual settings is **signature type = authorized in external systems**.

If payment before sign is required:

- the system generates payment information

- based on the node contract configuration,



- the system does nothing, OR

- the system generates policy precontract, OR

- the system generates policy precontract and sends to e-mail


- before further steps, the policy needs to be in status "paid".


If payment before sign is not required:

- based on the node contract configuration,



- the system does nothing, OR

- the system generates policy precontract, OR

- the system generates policy precontract and sends to e-mail


Then, the policy signature has to be confirmed by partner by using API call:

- `/api/policies/{id}/confirm-signature`



- where id = ID of a policy to which partner wishes to confirm signature, and

- where confirmationCode is the code that partner previously obtained from the system when performing policy lock


After this:

- the policy is confirmed,

- based on the node contract configuration,



- the system does nothing, OR

- the system generates policy contract, OR

- the system generates policy contract and sends to e-mail


### [Direct link to heading](https://defend-insurance-holding.gitbook.io/api-documentation/steps-for-creating-policy/signatures-payments\#if-signature-type-authorized-by-sms)    If signature type = authorized by SMS

If payment before sign **is required**:

- the system generates payment information

- based on the node contract configuration,



- the system does nothing, OR

- the system generates policy precontract, OR

- the system generates policy precontract and sends to e-mail


- before further steps, the policy needs to be in status "paid".


If payment before sign **is not required**:

- based on the node contract configuration,



- the system does nothing, OR

- the system generates policy precontract, OR

- the system generates policy precontract and sends to e-mail


Then, the system sends SMS and the policy signature has to be confirmed by partner by using API call:

- `/api/policies/{id}/confirm-signature`



- where id = ID of a policy to which partner wishes to confirm signature, and

- where confirmationCode is the code that partner previously obtained from the system when performing policy lock


After this:

- based on the node contract configuration,



- the system does nothing, OR

- the system generates policy contract, OR

- the system generates policy contract and sends to e-mail


### [Direct link to heading](https://defend-insurance-holding.gitbook.io/api-documentation/steps-for-creating-policy/signatures-payments\#if-signature-type-authorization-not-required)    If signature type = authorization not required

In such case, the authorization is not required, so only configuration of payments before sign taken into account.

If payment before sign is required:

- the system generates payment information

- before further steps, the policy needs to be in status "paid".


If payment before sign is not required:

- no action is done.


After this:

- the policy is confirmed by default,

- based on the node contract configuration,



- the system does nothing, OR

- the system generates policy contract, OR

- the system generates policy contract and sends to e-mail


### [Direct link to heading](https://defend-insurance-holding.gitbook.io/api-documentation/steps-for-creating-policy/signatures-payments\#if-signature-type-signed-proposal)    If signature type = signed proposal

If payment before sign is required:

- the system generates payment information

- based on the node contract configuration,



- the system does nothing, OR

- the system generates policy precontract, OR

- the system generates policy precontract and sends to e-mail


- before further steps, the policy needs to be in status "paid".


If payment before sign is not required:

- the system generates policy precontract


Then, the policy signature has to be confirmed by partner.

### [Direct link to heading](https://defend-insurance-holding.gitbook.io/api-documentation/steps-for-creating-policy/signatures-payments\#if-signature-type-authorized-by-payment)    If signature type = authorized by payment

In this case, it does not matter, what is the configuration of required payment before sign. The payment information is generated always.

The steps are:

- the system generates payment information

- based on the node contract configuration,



- the system does nothing, OR

- the system generates policy precontract, OR

- the system generates policy precontract and sends to e-mail


After this:

- the policy is confirmed by default,

- based on the node contract configuration,



- the system does nothing, OR

- the system generates policy contract, OR

- the system generates policy contract and sends to e-mail
