After policy is signed and (optionally) paid, the policy is awaiting approval from the system.

After approval is given, the next step is to upload required documents. Firstly, partner checks the list of missing files needed for upload:

- `/api/policies/{id}/missing-upload-types`



- where id = ID of the policy that we are currently working with


Then a list of missing documents is returned.

Upload of necessary documents is done through:

- `/api/policies/{id}/uploads`



- where id = ID of the policy that we are currently working with
